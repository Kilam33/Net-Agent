### Advanced Python Function: Decorators with Generators and Lambda Functions
Here's an example of an intermediate Python function that incorporates several critical fundamentals:
```python
from functools import wraps

def debug_decorator(func):
    """A decorator that logs function calls and their results."""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with arguments: {args}, {kwargs}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

# Using the decorator with a generator function
@debug_decorator
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generates the first n Fibonacci numbers."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using a lambda function to filter the Fibonacci sequence
filtered_fib = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, fibonacci(10)))

print("Filtered Fibonacci numbers:", filtered_fib)
```
This example demonstrates the following advanced Python concepts:

*   **Decorators**: `debug_decorator` is a function that takes another function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that "wraps" the original function. This allows for code reuse and modification of existing functions without altering their source code.
*   **Generators**: The `fibonacci` function uses a generator to produce a sequence of Fibonacci numbers on-the-fly, rather than computing them all at once and storing them in a list. This approach is memory-efficient and flexible.
*   **Lambda functions**: The `filter` function uses a lambda function (`lambda x: x % 2 == 0`) to define a small, one-time-use function that filters the Fibonacci sequence to include only even numbers.
*   **Higher-order functions**: The `filter` function is a higher-order function because it takes another function (the lambda function) as an argument and applies it to each element of the input sequence.
*   **Function wrappers**: The `wraps` decorator from the `functools` module is used to preserve the metadata (name, docstring, etc.) of the original function when creating a wrapper function.

These concepts are essential building blocks for advanced Python programming and are used extensively in many libraries and frameworks.







Say less, here’s the cleaned-up version — **commands only** — all on one page, no fluff, ready to roll on Windows:

# Git Commands Cheat Sheet (For HTTPS Issues)

## 1. Check Remote Address

```bash
git remote -v
````

Update existing remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
```

Add a new remote:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
```

---

## 2. Check and Manage Credentials

Check credential helper:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper
```

Clear credential cache:

```bash
git credential-cache exit
```

---

## 3. Test Connection (HTTPS)

List remote refs:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
```

Pull latest changes (triggers auth prompt if needed):

```bash
git pull
```

---

## 4. View Git Config

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## (Optional) SSH Test (Not for HTTPS)

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
